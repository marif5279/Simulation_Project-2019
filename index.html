            Apparent Magnitude Simulation
        </heading>
        <p>
            Most celestial bodies emit a set brightness which is determined by its distance and luminosity among other factors.
            <br />
            Brightness can also be referred to as the Magnitude of the celestial body.
            <br />
            Apparent Brightness is measured in relation to Zero Point Luminosity, Absolute Brightness/Magnitude, 
            and the other factors named above.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>Apparent Brightness is denoted by the formula:</p>
        <div class = "formula">
            B = A - 5 * 5 * log10(D)
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>A is Absolute Magnitude</li>
            <li>D is Distance (Parsecs)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Absolute Brightness is denoted by the formula:</p>
        <div class = "formula">
            A = -2.5 * log10(L/zL)
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>L is Luminosity (Watts or Joules per Seconds)</li>
            <li>zL is Zero Point Luminosity (Constant with the value 3.0128 * 10^28)</li>
